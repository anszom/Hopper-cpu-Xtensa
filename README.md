# Xtensa disassembler plugin for [Hopper Disassembler](https://www.hopperapp.com)
This is a CPU plugin for the Xtensa architecture, notably used in the ESP8266 & ESP32 chips. 

This is an early release, just barely working. No attempts were made to support lx6 yet (ESP32).

Disassembly code heavily based on pfalcon's [ida-xtensa2](https://github.com/pfalcon/ida-xtensa2)

# Building
